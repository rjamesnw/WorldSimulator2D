    LICENSE

The license currently comes in two parts:

## Part 1: World Simulation Engine

All files related to the World Simulation Engine (mostly TypeScript files) fall under this section. 

### Non-Commercial Use
Such as:

1. Personal use.
2. Open-source use, or use with other free products.
3. Student/Educational use.

In all these cases this is the license that applies: 

[Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/)


### Commercial Use

This applies to:

1. Commercial use where any profit is below $1000 USD per product per calendar quarter (every 3 months), with a 0% royalty. This allows anyone to start making commercial games with no upfront engine cost, and little to lose - except your own time! ;)
2. Commercial use where any profit is equal to or above $1000 USD per product per calendar quarter (every 3 months), and a 2% royalty.  The royalty is used to help improve the project and keep it alive (which is fair if you are profiting from it, and gives you peace of mind).

In all these cases this is the license that applies: 

[Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-ND 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/)

Exception: Where it states "Attribution â€” You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license", for commercial works, this can be as simple as a mention in the credits screen (no link required).

## Part 2: World Simulation Engine IDE

This is the website part that allows constructing world simulations. The IDE is only under this one simple license:

[Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)

Just keep in mind any distributions of the engine with derivatives made of the IDE must still follow the engine licensing terms in part 1 (for the engine), which is separate.
